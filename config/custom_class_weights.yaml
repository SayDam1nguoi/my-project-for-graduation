# Custom Class Weights for Emotion Recognition
# Target: Happy ~47%, reduce Sad and Neutral
# Based on weighted loss formula: weight = 1.0 / sqrt(class_count)

# Emotion order: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral

class_weights:
  Angry: 1.0      # Keep balanced
  Disgust: 1.2    # Slightly boost (rare emotion)
  Fear: 1.1       # Slightly boost
  Happy: 3.5      # BOOST SIGNIFICANTLY (target ~47%)
  Sad: 0.6        # REDUCE (too common, negative)
  Surprise: 1.0   # Keep balanced
  Neutral: 0.5    # REDUCE SIGNIFICANTLY (too common, boring)

# Explanation:
# - Happy gets 3.5x weight to make model more sensitive to happy faces
# - Sad gets 0.6x weight to reduce over-detection of sadness
# - Neutral gets 0.5x weight to avoid classifying everything as neutral
# - Other emotions stay balanced

# Expected outcome after training:
# - Model will be more likely to predict Happy when uncertain
# - Model will be less likely to predict Sad or Neutral
# - Overall accuracy may decrease slightly but user satisfaction increases
